(1)
The implementation of data sequencing and retransmission in the provided UDP-based code differs significantly from traditional TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Here are the key differences:

a) Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless:

   Traditional TCP: 
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning it establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transfer. It ensures reliability through a combination of mechanisms like acknowledgment, sequencing, and retransmission. TCP maintains the state of each connection and provides guaranteed delivery of data.

   Provided UDP Code:
The provided code uses UDP, which is connectionless. UDP does not establish a connection before data transfer and lacks built-in reliability mechanisms like acknowledgment, sequencing, or retransmission. The provided code implements these mechanisms manually.

b) Reliability Mechanisms:

   Traditional TCP:
 TCP ensures reliability through features such as acknowledgments, sliding window, and sequence numbers. It guarantees in-order delivery of data, retransmits lost or out-of-order packets, and manages flow control.

   Provided UDP Code:
The provided code manually implements data sequencing and retransmission by dividing data into chunks, assigning sequence numbers to chunks, and retransmitting chunks that are not acknowledged. It does not guarantee in-order delivery, and out-of-order packets are not handled.

c) Flow Control:

  Traditional TCP:
TCP incorporates flow control mechanisms to prevent congestion and ensure efficient data transfer. It uses features like window size and acknowledgments to control the rate of data transmission.

  Provided UDP Code:
The provided code does not include flow control mechanisms. It sends data as quickly as possible without adjusting to the receiver's capacity or network conditions, which can potentially lead to network congestion.

d) Acknowledgment Handling:

   Traditional TCP:
 In TCP, acknowledgments are sent by the receiver to confirm the successful receipt of data. TCP handles retransmissions based on missing acknowledgments.

  Provided UDP Code:
The provided code uses custom acknowledgments for data chunks. If a chunk is not acknowledged within a timeout period, it is retransmitted. However, it does not handle acknowledgment loss or out-of-order acknowledgments as comprehensively as TCP.

e) Congestion Control:

   Traditional TCP:
TCP has built-in congestion control mechanisms that adapt to network conditions, reducing the sending rate when congestion is detected and gradually increasing it when the network is less congested.

   Provided UDP Code:
The provided code does not implement congestion control. It sends data at a fixed rate, which may not adapt to changing network conditions and can potentially lead to congestion.

To extend the implementation to account for flow control, we can implement a simple flow control mechanism using concepts similar to TCP's sliding window protocol. Flow control ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with data and adapts to the receiver's capacity. Consider the following steps:

1. Sender-Side Flow Control:
   - The sender maintains two variables: `next_seq_num` and `window_size`.
   - `next_seq_num` is the sequence number of the next chunk to be sent.
   - `window_size` is the maximum number of unacknowledged chunks allowed.

2. Receiver-Side Flow Control:
   - The receiver maintains a variable `expected_seq_num`, which is the sequence number of the next expected chunk.
   - The receiver sends acknowledgments (ACKs) for received chunks. The ACK contains the sequence number of the next expected chunk.

3. Sender Behavior :
   - The sender sends chunks within the current window, i.e., from `next_seq_num` to `next_seq_num + window_size - 1`.
   - It waits for ACKs for the sent chunks.
   - When an ACK is received, it updates `next_seq_num` based on the ACKed sequence number.
   - If the sender's window is not full (`next_seq_num + window_size <= total_chunks`), it can send more data. Otherwise, it waits for ACKs to free up space in the window.

4. Receiver Behavior :
   - The receiver receives chunks and checks if the received chunk's sequence number matches `expected_seq_num`.
   - If they match, the receiver processes the chunk and increments `expected_seq_num`.
   - The receiver sends ACKs with the updated `expected_seq_num` for each received chunk.

5. Timeouts and Retransmissions :
   - Implement a timeout mechanism for the sender. If it doesn't receive an ACK for a chunk within a certain time, it retransmits that chunk and continues to send from `next_seq_num` onward.

6. Dynamic Window Sizing:
   - Implement dynamic window sizing based on network conditions. You can increase the window size when the network is performing well and decrease it when congestion is detected.

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement error detection and correction mechanisms as needed. For example, you can use checksums to verify data integrity.
